# Troubleshooting and Resetting a Password in Microsoft Azure

## Introduction
In this project, I used one of my virtual machines (VMs) to troubleshoot and reset the password in order to gain access to my account after being locked out.

## Steps

### Step 1: Attempt to Access the Account
I started by attempting to brute force into the account multiple times.

### Step 2: Account Locked
After several attempts to log into the account, an error message was generated by the system, indicating that my account has been blocked following too many “bad login attempts”.

### Step 3: Access VM Dashboard to Reset Password
I accessed my virtual machine’s dashboard to reset the password. The image shows that I am inside my “attack-vm” and the IP address is verified to be the same VM.

### Step 4: Create a New Password
Once inside the VM, I created a new password that would allow me to regain access to my virtual machine so I could deploy it.

### Step 5: Deploy the VM with the Updated Password
After creating a new password, I successfully deployed my virtual machine with the updated password. The Virtual Machine’s IP address matches the one from the beginning.

## Project Overview
As a security analyst for any organization, encountering situations where we need to re-generate passwords for employees is common. This task ensures business continuity by allowing employees to regain access to the systems. This guide demonstrates the process of troubleshooting and resetting a password in Microsoft Azure, highlighting the importance of managing access and maintaining security protocols effectively.
